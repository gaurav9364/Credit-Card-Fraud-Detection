## 📊 Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a significant problem in financial services.  
This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions from imbalanced datasets.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Handling class imbalance with **SMOTE / undersampling**
- Feature scaling
- Model training with multiple ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Visualization of results (confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.)
